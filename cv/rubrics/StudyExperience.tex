 %        Deep Learning based on Convolutional Neural Network(CNN): I developed a face recognition  system for commercial applications. It can be work in common operating systems such as Windows, Linux and some other embedded systems. Notably, my face recognition system has a very good performance in different applications, for example, face comparison and identity verification,  which can be utilized for attendance, hotel check-in, airport security, criminal investigation case, banking affairs, etc.
